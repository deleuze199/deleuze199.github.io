        <p>The words genetically modified organisms have come to gain a negative connotation over the years. Even people that don't understand what GMO’s means don't like the idea of it. A GMO is an organism that has had its genetic material altered in a way that does not occur in nature. In most instances genetically modified organisms are used because they can undergo more stress and can survive disease more easily than unmodified organisms. 
	Pamela C. Ronald is a plant geneticist. She is a professor in the Genome Center and the Department of Plant Pathology at the University of California, Davis. Pamela Ronald says (2015), “ I work on rice, which is a staple food for more than half the world's people. Each year, 40 percent of the potential harvest is lost to pest and disease.” In some parts of this portion of the world, rice is a entire meal to survive off of. Ronald also states (2015),
	For this reason, farmers plant rice varieties that carry genes for resistance. This approach 		has been used for nearly 100 years. Yet, when I started graduate school, no one knew 		what these genes were. It wasn't until the 1990s that scientists finally uncovered the 		genetic basis of resistance. In my laboratory, we isolated a gene for immunity to a very 		serious bacterial disease in Asia and Africa.
